# Use the "clienttype" directive to specify whether StreamingLoadTool should make
# RTSP / UDP connections or RTSP / HTTP connections or . Say "http" for
# the latter, "udp" for the former. Say "reliableudp" for reliable UDP.
# Say "tcp" for straight interleaved RTSP / RTP
clienttype reliableudp

# If doing RTSP / HTTP, set droppost to "yes" if you would like StreamingLoadTool
# to drop the POST half of each RTSP / HTTP connection after sending the
# PLAY. "yes" best emulates the "real" client behavior.
droppost yes

# Set this to the # of concurrent clients you would like StreamingLoadTool to maintain
concurrentclients	1

# Specify a connection port for each connection
port		554

# Specify a proxy IP address in dotted-decimal form. If 0, StreamingLoadTool
# will not use a proxy to connect
proxyip		0

# Client window (size of UDP socket buffers).
# For reliable UDP, this affects packet loss and the server's
# retransmission algorithm

# StreamingLoadTool should send a TEARDOWN after streaming for this # of seconds

# If runforever is set to "no", StreamingLoadTool will quit after finishing the
# list of URLs provided below. If "yes" StreamingLoadTool will loop forever.
runforever	yes

# Each instance of StreamingLoadTool must have a unique httpcookie value. This
# can also be specified on the command-line (see usage by doing StreamingLoadTool -v)
httpcookie	1

# Set to "yes" if you would like StreamingLoadTool to generate a connection log
shouldlog	yes

appendjunk	no

# Location to place the connection log

# Interval in milliseconds between attempts to read media data. For acking
# udp clients, this is also the interval between acks.
readinterval 10

# how late should packets be allowed to be sent? Value is in seconds.
# 0 = no late tolerance will be specified at all
latetolerance 0

# The "Packet-Range" header is used as an alternative to the standard "Range"
# header on a Play request for specifying a range of packets. Leave
# this line blank to issue a standard play, specify a packet range header
# here to send that instead of standard Range header.

# The overbuffer window size is the number of K bytes the server can send

overbufferwindowsize 5192

# Set this to be the value of the x-RTP-Meta-Info header sent to the server.
# If it is empty, no x-RTP-Meta-Info header will be sent. Otherwise, specify
